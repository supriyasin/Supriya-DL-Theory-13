    "\"\"\"Logistic Regression and Perceptron are both linear classifiers used for binary classification tasks, but there\n",
    "   are some differences between them. Generally, using a Logistic Regression classifier is preferable over a classical\n",
    "   Perceptron for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Probabilistic Interpretation: Logistic Regression provides a probabilistic interpretation of the output, whereas\n",
    "      Perceptron only gives a binary decision boundary. Logistic Regression outputs the probability of an instance \n",
    "      belonging to a particular class, which can be useful for various tasks, such as ranking or estimating confidence \n",
    "      levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Continuous Predictions: Logistic Regression produces continuous predictions that represent the probability of\n",
    "      belonging to a certain class, ranging from 0 to 1. Perceptron, on the other hand, provides a discrete output\n",
    "      of either 0 or 1. The continuous nature of Logistic Regression allows for more flexibility and finer-grained \n",
    "      predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Differentiable Function: Logistic Regression uses a logistic (sigmoid) function as the activation function,\n",
    "      which is differentiable. This differentiability enables the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms for\n",
    "      efficient training. Perceptron uses a step function, which is not differentiable, making it difficult to optimize\n",
    "      using gradient-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Handling Outliers: Logistic Regression is more robust to outliers and noisy data compared to Perceptron. \n",
    "      The logistic function smoothly transitions from 0 to 1, which helps mitigate the impact of outliers.\n",
    "      Perceptron, being based on a step function, can be more sensitive to outliers and may converge to incorrect\n",
    "      solutions.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  1. Change Activation Function: Replace the step function in the Perceptron with a logistic (sigmoid) function. \n",
    "     The logistic function maps the linear combination of inputs to a value between 0 and 1, allowing for probabilistic \n",
    "     interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Update Learning Rule: Replace the Perceptron learning rule with a gradient-based optimization algorithm such as\n",
    "     stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants. This modification enables the training of weights based\n",
    "     on the gradient of the logistic function, similar to how Logistic Regression is trained.\n",

    "\"\"\"The logistic activation function, also known as the sigmoid function, played a key role in training the first \n",
    "   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Differentiability: The logistic activation function is differentiable, meaning its derivative exists at all points. \n",
    "      This property is crucial for using gradient-based optimization algorithms, such as backpropagation, to train MLPs\n",
    "      efficiently. The ability to calculate gradients enables the adjustment of weights and biases through gradient\n",
    "      descent, which is a fundamental process in training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Output Range: The logistic function maps its input to a range between 0 and 1. This output range aligns with the \n",
    "      interpretation of a probability, where the output value represents the probability of an instance belonging to a \n",
    "      certain class. This property is particularly useful for binary classification tasks, where the logistic function \n",
    "      can be used to model the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Smoothness: The sigmoid function has a smooth and continuous curve. Its smoothness helps in providing a well-behaved \n",
    "      gradient throughout the activation range, making it easier to optimize the network's parameters. The smoothness of \n",
    "      the logistic function allows for more stable and gradual updates to the weights during backpropagation, preventing \n",
    "      abrupt changes that can hinder convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Nonlinearity: The logistic activation function introduces nonlinearity into the network. MLPs with only linear \n",
